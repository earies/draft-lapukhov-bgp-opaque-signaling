        Border Gateway Protocol with multi-protocol extensions (MP-BGP) <xref target="RFC4760"/> enables the use of the protocol for dissemination of virtually any information. This document proposes a new Address Family/Subsequent Address Family to be used for distribution of opaque data. This functionality is intended to be used by applications other than BGP for exchange of their own data on top of BGP mesh. The structure of such data is not to be interpreted by the regular BGP speakers, rather the goal is to use BGP purely as a convenient and scalable communication system.

    <section title="Introduction" anchor="intro" toc="default">
      <t>
        Implementation of <xref target="RFC4760">Multiprotocol Extensions for BGP-4</xref> allows to pass aribtrary data in BGP protocol messages. This capability has been leveraged by many for dissemination of non-routing related information over BGP (for example, see "Dissemination of Flow Specification Rules" defined in <xref target="RFC5575"/>). However, there has been no channel defined explicitly to disseminate data with arbitrary opaque payload. The intended use case is for applications other than BGP to leverage the protocol machinery for distribution of their own state in the network domain. Publishers and consumers will use BGP UPDATE messages to exhcnage opaque data. It is up to the BGP implementation to provide a custom API for message producers or consumers if needed. 
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title="BGP Opaque Data AFI" toc="default">
      <t>
        This document introduces a new AFI known as a "BGP Opaque Data AFI" with the actual value to be assigned by IANA. The purpose of this AFI is to exchange opaque information within a BGP network.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title="BGP Key-Value SAFI" toc="default">
      <t>
        This document introduces a new SAIF known as "BGP Key-Value SAFI". The purpose of this SAFI is exchange of opaque information structured as a Key-Value binding (advertisement).
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title="Capability Advertisement" toc="default">
      <t>
        A BGP speaker that wishes to exchange Opaque Data MUST use the Multiprotocol Extensions Capability Code, as defined in <xref target="RFC2858"/>, to advertise the corresponding AFI/SAFI pair.
      </t>
    </section>    
    <section title="Disseminating Key-Value bindings" toc="default">
      <t>
        This document proposes to implement a distributed, eventually consistent Key-Value store on top of existing BGP protocol mechanics. The proposal is for "Key" portion to be encoded as the NLRI part of MP_REACH_NLRI attribute and "Value" encoded using a new optional transitive attribute. 
        <list>
          <t>
            Publishers, acting as BGP speakers, advertise keys along with associated values into the routing domain. The BGP network synchronizes that state by propagating the encoded data following regular BGP protocol operations. 
          </t>
          <t>
            Consumers, acting as BGP speakers, receive the information via BGP protocol UPDATE messages. Only publishers and consumers of the opaque data are supposed to interpret its contents - the rest of the BGP network acts merely as a dissemination system.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        Multiple publishers can advertise the same key (NLRI) associated with different values. It is also possible for the advertised associations to have the same Key-Value pairs but differ in there other BGP attributes. In that case, BGP would follow the best-path selection logic to prevent duplicate information in the network. A consumer will receive the value created by the publisher "closest" in terms of BGP best-path selection logic, based on the policies that exist in the routing domain. This document does not propose any method of achieving global consensus for all published values for a given key. See section <xref target="add_path"/> that discusses the means of propagating multiple values for the same key.
      </t>  
      <section title="Publishing a Key-Value binding" toc="default">
        <t>
          The encoding scheme proposed below follows the semantics of a Key-Value bindings. The "Key" is stored in the NLRI section of the MP_REACH_NLRI attribute, as shown on <xref target="mp_reach_nlri"/>.

      <section title="Propagating multiple values for the same key" anchor="add_path" toc="default">
        <t>
           It is possible to propagate multiple values associated with the same key using the Add-Path extension defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-idr-add-paths" />. The values are differentiated by the Path Identifier field present in the key. If the capability is negotiated between two BGP speakers, the key encoding in NLRI field of MP_REACH_NLRI and MP_UNREACH_NLRI attributes is extended to look as shown on <xref target="add_path_encoding"/>. The "Opaque Key Length" and "Opaque Key Data" retain the same meaning as defined previously.

        <figure title="AddPath Encoding" anchor="add_path_encoding" suppress-title="false" align="left" alt="" width="" height="">

        </figure>  
        <t>
          The above defined encoding is to be used both with MP_REACH_NLRI and MP_UNREACH_NLRI attributes. It is up to the implementation to decide how many additional values to propagate with the key.
        </t>
        <t>
          Note that the Add-Path extension could also be used to propagate the same Key-Value pairs with different Path Identifiers, assuming that other BGP attributes associated with the same NLRI are different.

    <section title="Message filtering" toc="default">
      <t>
        Limiting the scope of opaque information flooding is an important operational concern. BGP already has the mechanisms needed to control this process, and these mechanisms are briefly reviewed below. 
      </t>
      <section title="Automated filtering">
        <t>
          One can leverage mechanics presented in <xref target="RFC4684"/> and use the route-target extended community attribute to identify "channels" where key-value bindings are published. The consumers would signal their interest in particular "channel" by advertising the corresponding router-target membership. The publications then need to contain the router-target extended community attribute to constrain information propagation.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Filtering via policy">
        <t>
          Ad-doc message filtering could be implemented using BGP standard (see <xref target="RFC4271"/>) or extended community attributes (see <xref target="RFC4360"/>). The semantic of these attributes is to determined by the policy and publishers/consumers. Filtering could be done locally on receiving speaker, or on remote speaker, by using outbound route filtering feature defined in <xref target="RFC5291"/>.
