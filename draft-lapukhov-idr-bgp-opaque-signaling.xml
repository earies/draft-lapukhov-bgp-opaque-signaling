        Border Gateway Protocol with multi-protocol extensions (MP-BGP)
        enables the use of the protocol for dissemination of virtually
        any information. This document proposes a new Address
        Family/Subsequent Address Family to be used for distribution of
        opaque data. This functionality is intended to be used by
        applications other than BGP for exchange of their own data on
        top of BGP mesh. The structure of such data MAY to be
        interpreted by the regular BGP speakers, rather the goal is to
        use BGP purely as a convenient and scalable communication
        system.

      <t>
        Implementation of <xref target="RFC4760">Multiprotocol
        Extensions for BGP-4</xref> gives the ability to pass
        arbitrary data in BGP protocol messages. This capability has
        been leveraged by many for dissemination of non-routing related
        information over BGP (e.g. <xref target="RFC5575">"Dissemination
        of Flow Specification Rules"</xref> as well as <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-idr-ls-distribution">"North-Bound
        Distribution of Link-State and TE Information using
        BGP"</xref>). However, there has been no channel defined
        explicitly to disseminate data with arbitrary payload. The
        intended use case is for applications other than BGP to leverage
        the protocol machinery for distribution (broadcasting) of their
        own state in the network domain. Publishers and consumers will
        use BGP UPDATE messages to submit and receive opaque data. It is
        up to the BGP implementation to provide a custom API for message
        producers or consumers if needed. 
      </t>
      <t>
        One possible application of this extension is building and testing 
        new routing protocols or BGP extensions transparently co-existing 
        with the current implementation. The new protocol/extension may 
        influence routing either  bydirectly talking to the RIB/FIB of 
        the router it runs on, or by overriding BGP paths via BGP route 
        injection, thus using BGP both for its own state dissemination and 
        FIB programming. An example of such BGP extension could be

    <section title="BGP Opaque Data AFI" toc="default">
      <t>
        This document introduces a new AFI known as a "BGP Opaque Data
        AFI" with the actual value to be assigned by IANA. The purpose
        of this AFI is to exchange opaque information within a BGP
        network.

    </section>
    <section title="BGP Key-Value SAFI" toc="default">
      <t>
        This document introduces a new SAFI known as "BGP Key-Value
        SAFI" with the actual value to be assigned by IANA. The purpose
        of this SAFI is exchange of opaque information structured as a
        Key-Value binding.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title="Capability Advertisement" toc="default">
      <t>
        A BGP speaker that wishes to exchange Opaque Data MUST use the
        Multiprotocol Extensions Capability Code, as defined in <xref
        target="RFC4760"/>, to advertise the corresponding AFI/SAFI
        pair.
      </t>
    </section>    
    <section title="Disseminating Key-Value bindings" toc="default">
      <t>
        This document proposes to implement a distributed, eventually
        consistent Key-Value store on top of existing BGP protocol
        mechanics. The "Key" portion is to be encoded as the NLRI part 
        of MP_REACH_NLRI attribute and "Value" encoded using a new 
        optional transitive attribute. 
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>
            Publishers, acting as BGP speakers, advertise keys along
            with associated values into the routing domain. The BGP
            network synchronizes that state by propagating the encoded
            data following regular BGP protocol operations. 
          </t>
          <t>
            Consumers, acting as BGP speakers, receive the information
            via BGP protocol UPDATE messages. Only publishers and
            consumers of the opaque data are supposed to interpret its
            contents - the rest of the BGP network acts merely as a
            dissemination system. 
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        Multiple publishers can advertise the same key (NLRI) bound to
        different values. It is also possible for the advertised binding
        to have the same Key-Value pairs but differ in some other BGP
        attributes. In that case, BGP would follow the best-path
        selection logic to prevent duplicate information in the network.
        A consumer will receive the value created by the publisher
        "closest" in terms of BGP best-path selection logic, based on
        the policies that exist in the routing domain. This document
        does not propose any method of achieving global consensus for
        all published values for a given key.

        <t>
          The encoding scheme proposed below follows the semantics of a
          Key-Value bindings. The "Key" is stored in the NLRI section of
          the MP_REACH_NLRI attribute, as shown on <xref

        <t>
           It is possible to propagate multiple values associated with
           the same key using the Add-Path extension defined in <xref
           target="I-D.ietf-idr-add-paths" />. However, this
           document recommends that instead unique key values be used
           for this purpose. It is up to the consumers and publishers of
           the opaque data to settle on single unique value using some
           kind of consensum protocol.

    <section title="Message filtering" toc="default">
      <t>
        Limiting the scope of opaque information flooding is an
        important operational concern. BGP already has the mechanisms
        needed to control this process, and these mechanisms are briefly
        reviewed below. 
      </t>
      <section title="Automated filtering">
        <t>
          One can leverage mechanics presented in <xref
          target="RFC4684"/> and use the route-target extended
          community attribute to identify "channels" where key-value
          bindings are published. The consumers would signal their
          interest in particular "channel" by advertising the
          corresponding router-target membership. The publications then
          need to contain the router-target extended community attribute
          to constrain information propagation.

      </section>
      <section title="Filtering via policy">
        <t>
          Ad-doc message filtering could be implemented using BGP
          standard (see <xref target="RFC4271"/>) or extended community
          attributes (see <xref target="RFC4360"/>). The semantic of
          these attributes is to determined by the policy and
          publishers/consumers. Filtering could be done locally on
          receiving speaker, or on remote speaker, by using outbound
          route filtering feature defined in <xref target="RFC5291"/>.
